# Project 1. Daily Water Intake & Hydration Status Prediction (Classification)

  Project Overview
  
        This project focuses on analyzing daily water consumption patterns and predicting an individual’s hydration status using             classification models. The goal is to understand how lifestyle and demographic factors influence hydration and to build a            machine learning model that can accurately classify hydration levels.

   Dataset Size: 10,000+ records

   Target Variable: Hydration Status (Good / Poor)

   Key Steps Performed:

          Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and class imbalance

          Data preprocessing:

              Handling missing values

              Encoding categorical variables

              Feature scaling

          Applied multiple classification algorithms

          Model comparison using performance metrics

          Saved the best-performing model

    Outcome

           The project successfully identifies hydration patterns and predicts hydration status with high accuracy. Tree-based                  ensemble models performed best due to their ability to capture non-linear relationships.



 # Project 2. College Student Placement Prediction (Classification)

   Project Overview:

        This project predicts whether a college student will get placed based on academic performance, skills, and personal                  attributes. The objective is to help understand key factors influencing student placement outcomes using machine learning            classification techniques.

   Dataset Size: 10,000 records

   Target Variable: Placement Status (Placed / Not Placed)

   Key Steps Performed:

        Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

        Feature engineering and preprocessing

        Handling categorical and numerical variables

        Applied and compared multiple classification models

        Probability-based prediction analysis

        Saved the final optimized model

    Outcome

        The model effectively predicts student placement outcomes. Students with higher IQ, stronger skills, and better academic performance show significantly higher placement probability.
